# SuperWar
Developed this app using https://superheroapi.com/ API and Firebase.

This app fetched data of superheroes and supervillains from the API and generates random battles between them, after generating 
the battle it will also fetch the powerstats of those characters.

It will then display all the powerstats and users can analyse who is more likely to win the battle and put their virtual money
on them. 

If the user predicts correctly $10 virtual money will be added to their account and if they lose $5 will be deducted
from their account.

Here is the demo of the app
